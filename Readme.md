## 📁 Project Structure,

```plaintext

README.md         # You're looking at it 😎
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

## 🧪 File Format: `.venomcfg`

- Not plain JSON!
- Base64-encoded and tagged with a secret key
- Can only be read and used by this app
- Example encoded string:
  ```
  VENOM_SUPREME_1337::<json>
  ```

## 🔐 Security Tip

To change the internal signature (secret key), edit this line in the JS:

```js
const SECRET_KEY = "VENOM_SUPREME_LEGEND_1337";
```

Only configs signed with this key will work. 🛡️
